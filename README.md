A registered user can right-click on a photo online. When selecting "I found a boat!" in the drop-down menu, the photo will be added to their account on BoatVote. Other users will then vote on the boat.

Users and non-registered users can vote on Boat-photos, as to whether or not the photo is a picture of a boat.
('That's a boat!', "I'm not sure if that's a boat", or "I don't think that's a boat.")

Top boat-watchers will appear on a top-five ranking list. Worst boat-watchers will appear on a bottom-five ranking list.

BoatVote appears to be on a single, fun, interactive page. The user never needs to change locations to enjoy all the features of boatvote.
